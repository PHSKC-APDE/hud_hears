## Background
Housing is a fundamental determinant of health, but housing costs have increased substantially in recent years. Federal subsidies enable only 20-25% of eligible low-income households to afford housing. One way to increase access is to support economic self-sufficiency so housing assistance is no longer required. However, little is known about outcomes after exit from housing assistance. Through an existing collaboration between public health and public housing, we sought to address this knowledge gap by comparing health outcomes following positive and negative housing exits.

## Methods
We used probabilistic matching to link public housing and Medicaid claims datasets in King County, WA. We categorized exits from housing as positive (e.g., income increase), negative (e.g., eviction), or neutral (e.g., moving in with family/friends). Our analysis looked at ED visits, hospitalizations, and well-child visits (among 2â€“6-year-olds) in the 12 months following exit. We used logistic regression to compare outcomes for those with positive vs. negative exits, adjusting for individual and household demographics, type of housing assistance, and health status (prior ED visits/hospitalizations, chronic conditions). We stratified results for well-child checks to test for effect modification.

## Results
Of the `r nrow(exit_nodeath[exit_nodeath$exit_category != "Neutral", ])` people exiting King County and Seattle Housing Authorities between 2012 and 2018, `r nrow(exit_nodeath[exit_nodeath$exit_category != "Nuetral" & exit_nodeath$full_cov_7_prior == 1  & exit_nodeath$full_cov_7_after == 1, ])` (`r round(nrow(exit_nodeath[exit_nodeath$exit_category != "Nuetral" & exit_nodeath$full_cov_7_prior == 1  & exit_nodeath$full_cov_7_after == 1, ])/nrow(exit_nodeath[exit_nodeath$exit_category != "Neutral", ])*100, 1)`%) had full Medicaid coverage 12 months either side of the exit date and were included in the analysis.

Those with a positive exit were `r ifelse(ed_adj_results[2, 1] < 1, "less", "more")` likely to have 1+ ED visits (OR = `r sprintf("%.2f", ed_adj_results[2, 1])`, 95% CI: `r sprintf("%.2f", ed_adj_results[2, 2])`-`r sprintf("%.2f", ed_adj_results[2, 3])`, `r ifelse(ed_adj_p < 0.01, "p<0.01", ifelse(ed_adj_p < 0.05, "p<0.05", paste0("p=", sprintf("%.2f", ed_adj_p))))`) and `r ifelse(hosp_adj_results[2, 1] < 1, "less", "more")` likely to have 1+ hospitalizations (OR = `r sprintf("%.2f", hosp_adj_results[2, 1])`, 95% CI: `r sprintf("%.2f", hosp_adj_results[2, 2])`-`r sprintf("%.2f", hosp_adj_results[2, 3])`, `r ifelse(hosp_adj_p < 0.01, "p<0.01", ifelse(hosp_adj_p < 0.05, "p<0.05", paste0("p=", sprintf("%.2f", hosp_adj_p))))`) following exit than those with a negative exit, after adjusting for demographics and prior ED visits/hospitalizations.

Among those with a well-child check in the 12 months prior to exit, a positive exit was not significantly associated with a well-child check after exit (p=`r sprintf("%.2f", wc_strat_wc_p)`). Among those without a recent well-child check, a positive exit was `r ifelse(wc_strat_no_wc_results[2, 1] < 1, "less", "more")` likely to lead to a well-child check after exiting than a negative exit (OR = `r sprintf("%.2f", wc_strat_no_wc_results[2, 1])`, 95% CI: `r sprintf("%.2f", wc_strat_no_wc_results[2, 2])`-`r sprintf("%.2f", wc_strat_no_wc_results[2, 3])`, `r ifelse(wc_strat_no_wc_p < 0.01, "p<0.01", ifelse(wc_strat_no_wc_p < 0.05, "p<0.05", paste0("p=", sprintf("%.2f", wc_strat_no_wc_p))))`).

## Conclusion
The reasons for exiting housing assistance matter in terms of subsequent health impacts; positive exits are more likely to precede certain positive health outcomes than negative exits. Policies and programs supporting positive transitions off housing assistance and preventing negative exits could improve longer-term outcomes for low-income households.
